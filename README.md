# Just Enough CSS (and Sass) for data scientists

**NCEAS Roundtable, August 2023**

While many of us in the broader data science community may not consider ourselves web developers, tools like Quarto and GitHub have made it more approachable than ever before to create, publish, and share HTML webpages. The default styling of these web pages is pretty sleek -- but knowing even just a *little bit* of CSS can help you transform your reports, websites, blog posts, presentation slides, etc. into personalized and stand-out web products. 

In this workshop-style Roundtable, we'll first introduce and interact with some HTML and CSS, the building blocks of all web pages. We'll then learn about how Sass extends CSS features to help simplify our stylesheets. Finally, we'll practice writing Sass and CSS to style a Quarto Markdown (.qmd) report.

If you'd like to follow along during this workshop, please be sure to review the [Setup instructions](https://github.com/samanthacsik/cute-cats-dogs#setup) beforehand.
