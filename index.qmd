1. [**install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)**]{.yellow-underline} -- I'll be using RStudio, though you may use alternative IDEs (e.g. VS Code) if that's where you're most comfortable
2. [**install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)**]{.yellow-underline} -- this may require updating R/RStudio if you already have those installed
3. [**grab the materials from GitHub**]{.yellow-underline}, <https://github.com/samanthacsik/cute-cats-dogs>, using one of the following approaches:
    a. [instructions for downloading the GitHub repository to work locally](https://github.com/samanthacsik/cute-cats-dogs/wiki/Download-the-GitHub-repository-to-work-locally) (do this if you **don't** have git/GitHub configured)
    b. [instructions for forking & cloning the GitHub respository](https://github.com/samanthacsik/cute-cats-dogs/wiki/Forking-&-Cloning-a-GitHub-respository) (do this if you **do** have git/GitHub configured)
