##  {#md-practice data-menu-title="Check out the corresponding markdown"}

[markdown makes it easy to "write" HTML]{.slide-title-smaller}

<!-- The same content written using markdown syntax in a `.qmd` file -->

<hr>

::: {.body-text .center-text}

```

## rendered HTML

::: {.body-text .center-text}
Click **Render** to render your `.qmd` file as HTML -- it should open in RStudio's Viewer pane and generate a `practice-markdown.html` file. **Note:** Quarto applies the default Bootstrap 5 theme to rendered markdown (giving it a bit of styling as compared to our HTML on the [previous slide](http://localhost:6131/#/practice-html)).

#| eval: true 
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "65%"
