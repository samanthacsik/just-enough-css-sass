â€¦and honestly, it's **a lot** of it is trial and error. Inspecting your website can take patience and persistence to figure out how exactly to target your desired element. Some things that have helped me:

::: incremental
- re-rendering often to ensure your Sass/CSS is working as expected
- Google! (lots of queries that look like, "CSS underline text", "CSS rounded corners", etc.)
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) -- seriously such a valuable resource (especially their interactive tutorials)
- drawing inspiration (and borrowing source code) from other webpages
